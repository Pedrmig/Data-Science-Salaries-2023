# Data Science Salaries 2023

This dataset is useful for understanding the distribution of salaries in the field of data science and how they can vary based on factors such as the location of the employee and the employer, the level of experience, the type of employment, among others. It allows us to explore the impact of remote work on data science salaries and begin drawing our own conclusions.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to learn and apply data analysis and visualization techniques using the Python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

### Steps to Complete

1. **Explore the Dataset**
   - Understand the structure of the dataset, the types of variables present, and how they are distributed.
   - Clean and prepare the dataset: Manipulate the data to make it more accessible and useful for analysis. This may include dealing with missing values, converting data types, and generating new variables from existing ones.

2. **Analyze the Dataset**
   - Extract useful and meaningful information from the dataset through various data analysis techniques.

3. **Visualize the Data**
   - Create charts and diagrams that help to understand and communicate the patterns and relationships present in the data.

### Libraries to Use

- **Matplotlib**: To create basic charts such as bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots.
- **Seaborn**: To create more complex and visually appealing charts, leveraging its capabilities to integrate with pandas.
- **Plotly**: To create interactive charts that allow for a deeper exploration of the data.
